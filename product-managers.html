                How is Omniflow different from other tools such as ChatGPT,
                Perplexity or ChatPRD?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Apps like ChatGPT and Perplexity lack collaboration and integration
                for teams. ChatPRD works for basics but isn't enough for serious
                team needs beyond PRD management.

              <h3>Can I just use Omniflow by myself first?</h3>
              <p>
                Absolutely! You can start using Omniflow on your own to experience
                how it streamlines your workflow. Although we recommend inviting
                your team to fully maximize its benefits.

              <h3>How can I collaborate with others on Omniflow?</h3>
              <p>
                Collaborating is very easy in Omniflow. You can invite your team
                members to your projects, share reports with them, connect all your
                work tools with Omniflow so that everyone in your team is on the
                same page.

                Do I have to stop using other tools if we start using Omniflow?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Not at all! Omniflow is meant to work with tools you already use.
                That's one of the USPs of using Omniflow. You don't have to change
                your workflows. We have integrations with most popular product and
                engineering tools.
