              <h3>How does Omniflow know my team's development velocity?</h3>
              <p>
                Omniflow enables your team/admin to adjust the development
                velocity for each team member, ensuring that workflows and plans
                are tailored to your team.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>
                A story point may mean different things from one team to
                another. How does Omniflow know what it means for my team?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You can easily set a baseline for your team's velocity and
                define what a story point means by adjusting the "Development
                Velocity" settings.

                My team is already using JIRA. Do we have to drop JIRA to start

              <p>

                efficiency.
